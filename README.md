# dbd_autoSurvive
An AI-based tool (Machine Learning) to help survivors in Dead by Daylight

Build upon my first project [dbd_autoSkillCheck](https://github.com/Manuteaa/dbd_autoSkillCheck), this repo aims to provide much more complete and advanced tools to help players to survive in dead by daylight.

We are in early phase of development, if you want to contribute, suggest features, or help us in any way, you can contact me on discord: manuteaa
